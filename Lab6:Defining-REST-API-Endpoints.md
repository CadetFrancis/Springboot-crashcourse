## Lab 6: Define Your REST API Endpoints
### Goal: 
In this lab, you will design and document the REST API endpoints for the Zoo Simulator. Defining your API up front ensures clarity, consistency, and maintainability across your project.

By completing this lab, youâ€™ll have a clear and well-structured API specification that can guide your controller and service implementation.
